# MUD-Maker (Unfinished)
This is a group project, we were working on MS Azure so I downloaded the files from Azure then push them to my Git Hub.

The goal of this project is to develop a **Multi-User Dungeon(MUD)** maker, which enables the admin to create different MUDs for users to 
play, by entering a new room the user will trigger different events only once.
